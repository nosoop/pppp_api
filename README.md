# libPPPP_API

## About

`libPPPP_API` appears to be a custom UDP protocol used for a number of security cameras,
including ["some random, noname spy camera from usual Chinese sources"][1], and the Uniden G755.

This repository is intended to chronicle the attempt to reverse-engineer the protocol well
enough to access the security cameras.

I will be using [`com.p2pcamera.app01`][unideng2] as the reference.
